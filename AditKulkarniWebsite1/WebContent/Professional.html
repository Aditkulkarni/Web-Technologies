		<h1 class="Sub_heading" ><b>Professional Summary</b></h1>
			<div class="professional_summary" style="text-align:justify;margin-right: 2%;margin-right: 1%;">
				<p>I am a graduate student at Marist College for the course Master's in Information Systems and Business Analtics, I am nearing my final exams for the last semester, and my aim is to maintain my current 3.9/4.0 GPA and try to score better. With my master's course nearing to the end. I have been looking at future career prospects after completion of this course. Before coming to the USA, I started my career working with working in my family business right after I completed my bachelor's degree in computer science from Ferguson College. I always aimed at having my own business. After working in my family business for 1 year I decided that I needed to have a more corporate experience to learn new and polish existing skills, with this thought I joined Syntel as a Quality Analyst. While I worked at Syntel for 3 years, I was fortunate enough to get an exposure of working with higher management in a short span of time, while I got the opportunity to work in a team of 7 members which was headed by the Vice President Sales & Marketing of Syntel (Now Atos-Syntel). Being the youngest member of a team which comprised of Delivery Directors and Managers I learned a lot about how proposals are made and how Syntel tried to acquire a contract from a conglomerate like FedEx. I was made part of the team because of my niche domain knowledge of FedEx Sortation Systems and my understanding of business because of the Post Graduate Diploma Course in Business Administration from Welingkar College, which was to come in handy when FedEx acquired TNT (another European Logistics Conglomerate) and Syntel was bidding for their ITES contract.</p>
